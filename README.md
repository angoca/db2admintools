db2admintools
=============

This project provides a set of scripts to ease the database administration.

These files do not need installation, you can execute them directly. Some
environment variables could be defined in order to modify the default
behaviour.

There are 4 directories, each with a different function.

 * bin
   * Set of scripts to perform a specific task.
 * conf
   * Configuration files to modify with your own environment.
 * deploy
   * Script to deploy this structure into multiple servers.
 * exec
   * Parallel execution in multiple servers, multiple instances and multiple
     databases.

Checkout the wiki for more information about how to install and use these scripts.
